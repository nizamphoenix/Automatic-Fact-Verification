# Automatic-Fact-Verification
A Machine learning system that solves the challenge of fake news detection by verifying a claim against a corpus.  

The famous **FEVER data set**(citations below) is used to build the verification system.  
A claim posited is either supported, refuted, or annulled depending upon evidence found in the corpus; it is annulled if no evidence is found either supporting or refuting the claim being made.  

The System is evaluated on 2 metrics,  
1. The proportion of claims that have been labeled correctly(accuracy), and  
2. The correctness of a set of relevant sentences(evidence) that have been identified to, apparently, support the label. Â 

Our system achieves a score of 45.14% and performs better than the baseline system for FEVER challenge which achieved a score of 33% in labeling the verdict; we address major drawbacks of the baseline system, viz. using entity matching along with an inverted index for information retrieval, pairwise entailment of a claim and each of the sentences retrieved by the information retrieval system, and employing universal sentence encoder for encoding the claim and relevant evidence to identify at most top-scoring 5 statements(evidence).
